Since graduating from CUNY JJAY with my B.S. in Computer Science, I've been continuing self-study through Udemy, YouTube, and reading documentation. My love for development started when I was just 12; I would build GUIs with Visual Studio, but I hadn't yet learned how to write functions to make those GUIs work. Now, I'm adept at React and its surrounding parts, so my buttons work when they're clicked on!",
